# Dataflow
This repository holds the 'Frac' Engine from which the Dataflow game (https://buas.itch.io/dataflow) was made.   
The project was made by BUAS students during Feb 2021 - June 2021 and in this current repository it has been stripped from all NDA material such as cross-platform code.  
All projects have been built and tested on a Windows device using vs2019 with SDK: 10.0.20348.0.  

Note: In order to build make sure to set the "TDGame" project as startup project.
